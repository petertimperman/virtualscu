# virtualscu
A virtual scanning control unit for testing PyScan.
##GOAL
Testing PyScan in any form requires that it must be connected to the SCU and that the SCU must be running. Therefore changes can only be made locally. The objective of this porgram is to create a "virtual SCU" that mimicks the serial communcation protocol and states of the real SCU.
